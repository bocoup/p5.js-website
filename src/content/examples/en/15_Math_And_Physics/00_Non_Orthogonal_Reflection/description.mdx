title: Non-Orthogonal Reflection
oneLineDescription: Simulate a ball bouncing on a slanted surface.
---

This example demonstrates a ball bouncing on a slanted
surface, implemented using vector calculations for reflection.

The code makes extensive use of the 
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a>
class, including the 
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createVector">createVector()</a> function to create new vectors,
and the vector methods
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Vector/add">add()</a>
and
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Vector/dot">dot()</a>
for the vector calculations.

Contributors from the p5 community wrote this example. Soon their names will 
appear here. In the meantime, you can
