Demonstration of multiple forces acting on bodies.
Bodies experience gravity continuously. Bodies experience fluid
resistance when in "water".

The force calculations are performed using the
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a>
class, including the
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createVector">createVector()</a>
function to create vectors.
