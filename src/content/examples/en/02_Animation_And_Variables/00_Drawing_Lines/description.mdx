Click and drag the mouse to draw a line.

This example demonstrates the use of several built-in
variables.

<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/mouseX">mouseX</a>
and
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/mouseY">mouseY</a>
store the current mouse position, while the previous mouse position is represented
by
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/pmouseX">pmouseX</a>
and
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/pmouseY">pmouseY</a>. * This example
also shows the use of
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/colorMode">colorMode</a> with HSB
(hue-saturation-brightness), so that the first variable sets the hue.
