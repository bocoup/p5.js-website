title: Framebuffer Blur
oneLineDescription: Simulate a camera's depth of field.

The
<a href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Shader" target="_blank">shader</a>
in this example uses depth information from a
<a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Framebuffer" target="_blank">p5.Framebuffer</a>
to apply a blur. On a real camera, objects appear blurred if they
are closer or farther than the lens's focus. This simulates that
effect. First, the sketch renders five spheres to the framebuffer.
Then, it renders the framebuffer to the canvas using the blur shader.
